This is the final Project of CS 229: Machine Learning, at Stanford University. This project combines finance and machine learning techniques, including deep learning and neural networks, to produce models aimed at predicting different aspects of the stock market.

The project title is: 'Data Driven Approach for Predicting Stock Index Movement and Prices Using S&P 500 Data'. 

I took this course in the Fall quarter of the 2018/2019 academic year.
