The underlying assumption of this principle, is that humans make decisions on which team/competitor is going to win in some sporting event in a binary fashion.
Those binary decisions form the true probability odds of the winner and loser.
However, those odds are skewed by emotional aspects such as the charisma of some competitor, or the likeability of the quarterback of some team, or the marketing acumen of said team. 
Those emotional aspects do no affect the outcome, but they do affect the amount of money bet and as a result the betting odds offered by bookies.
This algorithm exploits the differences between those offered betting odds and the the binary odds, to find value in Undervalued Underdogs or Discredited Favorites.
By repeatedly making those 'Value Bets' the algorithm ends up with a net win over long periods.

This Principle can also be applied to stock price movements.
