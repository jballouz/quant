Finance and Machine Learning Projects and Experiments

This repository contains the following projects:

1- Deep Neural Network and other Machine Learning techniques for predicting the S&P 500 Index movement and other stock movements.
This project was part of the CS229-Machine Learning course (at Stanford University), original title: Data Driven Approach for Predicting Stock Index Movement and Prices Using S&P 500 Data.

2- Underdog Betting Principle (Trademark Algorithm).
This betting algorithm is based on the simple assumption that humans are binary in their predictions of a winner vs. loser (i.e. Underdog vs. favorite) in any sporting event, however, the amounts that they bet are skewed by emotional elements. This betting principle exploits this discrepency by betting on undervalued underdogs as well as dicredited favorites. 
This strategy can also be applied to Stock movements.

3- Natural Language processing using Tweets to predict stock price movements.
This project scours Twitter (certain chosen accounts and hashtags) for tweets mentioning certain stocks, assigns a sentiment to those tweets (positive or negative), and from there predicts the direction and amplitude of the corresponding stock price movements.
